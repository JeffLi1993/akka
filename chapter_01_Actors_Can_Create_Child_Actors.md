Actors Can Create Child Actors## 角色可以创建子角色In the Actor Model, everything is an actor, and actors can communicate only through messages. But actors also need to know that other actors exist.角色模型中，每个东西都是角色，角色之间通过消息通信。但角色必须知道其他角色存在。One of the actions that is available to an actor when it receives a message is that it can create a finite number of child actors. The parent will then know about the child actor(s) and will have access to the child’s address. This means that a parent actor can send messages to a child actor.角色接收到消息时，一个有效的行为是它可以创建有限数量的子角色。父角色会知道子角色，并能访问子角色的地址。这样，父角色可以发送消息给子角色。In addition to knowing about actors by creating them as children, an actor can pass the address to another actor through a message. In this way, a parent could inform a child about any other actor the parent is aware of, including itself. Thus, a child actor can know the address of its parent or siblings with very little difficulty. With a little more work, the child can know about other actors that exist in the hierarchy, as well. In addition, if the address used for the actor follows a set pattern, it is possible to syn‐ thesize addresses for other actors, though this can create undesirable complexity, and possibly security concerns, if not used carefully.
