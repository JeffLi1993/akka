Actors Can Create Child Actors## 角色可以创建子角色In the Actor Model, everything is an actor, and actors can communicate only through messages. But actors also need to know that other actors exist.角色模型中，每个东西都是角色，角色之间通过消息通信。但角色必须知道其他角色存在。One of the actions that is available to an actor when it receives a message is that it can create a finite number of child actors. The parent will then know about the child actor(s) and will have access to the child’s address. This means that a parent actor can send messages to a child actor.角色接收到消息时，一个有效的行为是它可以创建有限数量的子角色。父角色会知道子角色，并能访问子角色的地址。这样，父角色可以发送消息给子角色。In addition to knowing about actors by creating them as children, an actor can pass the address to another actor through a message. In this way, a parent could inform a child about any other actor the parent is aware of, including itself. Thus, a child actor can know the address of its parent or siblings with very little difficulty. With a little more work, the child can know about other actors that exist in the hierarchy, as well. In addition, if the address used for the actor follows a set pattern, it is possible to syn‐ thesize addresses for other actors, though this can create undesirable complexity, and possibly security concerns, if not used carefully.除了通过创建子角色去知道角色之外，还可以通过消息发送角色地址给另一个角色。以这种方式，父角色可以通知子角色任何其知道的角色，包括其本身。因此，子角色可以很方便的知道父角色和兄弟角色的的地址。子角色也同样知道存在层次结构中的其他角色的地址。此外，如果角色的地址遵循设置的模式，可以对其他角色进行地址同步化。如果不小心使用的话，会产出不希望的复杂性及可能的安全问题。This hierarchy of actors means that with the exception of the root, all actors will have a parent and any actor can have one or more children. The collection of these actors, starting from the root and working down through the tree, is called an actor system.在这种层次结构的角色中，除了根角色，其他角色都有一个父角色。任何角色都可以有一个或者多个子角色。从根开始到各个分支角色的集合，被称为角色系统。Each actor in the actor system can always be uniquely identified by its address. It is not critical that it follow any particular pattern, so long as the address can be guaran‐ teed to uniquely identify an actor. Akka uses a hierarchical pattern of naming, much like a directory structure (similar to that shown in Figure 1-2), or you could use ran‐ domly generated unique keys.在角色系统中，每个角色通过其地址被唯一标识。其是否遵循某种特定的模式并不关键，地址就能保证标识唯一一个角色。Akka 使用分层模式命名，就像目录结构一样（如图 1-2 所示），或者可以随机生成唯一键。Figure 1-2. A hierarchical system of actors图 1-2 角色的分层系统In Figure 1-2, the root actor is the top-level actor under which all others will be cre‐ ated. The root actor then has two children A and B. The address for A is Root/A and the address for B is Root/B. Beneath A are two more actors named A and B. Even though these share the name of other actors, their address is still unique (Root/A/A and Root/A/B). Child B also has a child of its own with the path Root/B/A. Again, the address is unique, even if the name is not. This is just one example of how addresses can be created.在图 1-2 中，根角色是顶层角色。在它下面，创建其他所有角色。根角色拥有子角色 A 和子角色 B。A 角色地址是 Root/A，B 角色地址是 Root/B。在子角色 A 下面也有名为 A 和 B 的角色，即使名字相同，但是他们的地址是唯一的，分别为 Root/A/A 和 Root/B/B。子角色 B 也有自己的子角色和地址 Root/B/A。名称也不是唯一，但地址是唯一的。这是一个如何创建地址的案例。Child actors are one of the most valuable integration techniques in the Actor Model, and also form the basis of actor supervision in Akka, as we will see.在角色模型中，子角色是最有价值的集成技术。我们将会看到，子角色也是 Akka 角色监控的基础。
